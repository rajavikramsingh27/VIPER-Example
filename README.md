# A Proper VIPER Example found by me

View: Class that has all the code to show the app interface to the user and get their responses. Upon receiving a response View alerts the Presenter.
Interactor: Has the business logic of an app. e.g if business logic depends on making network calls then it is Interactorâ€™s responsibility to do so.
Presenter: Nucleus of a module. It gets user response from the View and works accordingly. 
           The only class to communicate with all the other components. Calls the router for wire-framing, 
           Interactor to fetch data (network calls or local data calls), view to update the UI.
Entity: Contains plain model classes used by the Interactor.
Router: Does the wire-framing. Listens from the presenter about which screen to present and executes that.
